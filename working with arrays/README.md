# Arrays

An array is also like a variable but can hold a large number of data. The data in an array are consider elements of the array. 

JavaScript arrays are the most dynamic arrays of any programming language. That's because JavaScript is a lose end language: variables are not declared with data types.

> `let arr = [ 1, "Miss" 3,"Master"]`;

Most programming languages makes you declare variables with data type like this:
> `int arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]`;

The array declared above is an integer array and can only hold integer values. In JavaScript because variables are declared with declaration keywords like *let, var, const* and not *int, string, char*.
We can store any value type as elements of the array either integer, strings, or characters without having **SYNTAX** errors in JavaScript.
JavaScript arrays are so dynamic they can also store objects as elements of the array.

```
let arr = [1, "string", "object" : {
    key : value
}]; 

```
