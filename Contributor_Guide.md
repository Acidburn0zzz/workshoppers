# Contributors Guide.

If you are reading this you are already a Node.js Africa contributor and you must have agreed to uphold the COC of the entire Node.js GitHub Org. We appreciate the effort you’ve decided to put-in to make our projects better and more comprehensive for learners like you, me and beginners too.
This guide is prepared to you walk through the contribution process in the best possible way. We’ve already prepared some course outline to help stay in scope for learners, these outlines can be found [here](https://github.com/nodejsafrica/nodejsafrica#ourguide). The document contains all areas we think will be helpful to a beginner to get ready and prepared for NDC (Node.js Developer Certification Exams) and he/her future using Node.js and contributing to Node.js to make it better and more efficient for we all as developers.

## Guide 
1.	Stay in scope to – Node.js Africa Outline (_we appreciate any form of abstract topics not included in the public document but **must** be related to JavaScript or Node.js_).
2.	Fork the project if necessary.
3.	Maintain naming conventions for Folders and Files.
4.	Every topic should be a folder and should contain a README.md as the index file.
5.	Your topic should follow the necessary learning flow, so learners don’t get confused with back and forth learning i.e. learning something advance before learning the basic. 
6.	You should avoid **5** completely. Try as much as possible to prepare topics in that light.
7.	Any topic that seems too advance before a basic topic is prepare by any other contributor, your PR won’t be merged until a more basic topic leading to that is prepared.
8.	Note that all contributions should be submitted as a PR.
9.	An issue should be open before submitting a topic **not** in scope.
10.	Existing topics can be edited you find any falsely.
11.	It’s important you note **not** to merge any file, until its approved by other collaborators or contributors.
12.	Your topics should contain follow up examples with real world approaches.
13.	They should be code, examples too. 
14.	Contributions with **no** example will **not** be merged, till they are provided (_this can be ignored if topic doesn’t necessarily need examples_).
15.	It’s important to note that other contributors with write access can edit falsely before your PR is merged.
16.	Respect any contribution made by other contributors, even when the topic is completely wrong. Ping them and help them politely with corrections.
17.	Contribution in other languages, other than English is highly welcomed.
18.	You **MUST** keep to the COC for contributors in the Node.js GitHub Org. NOTE: _the moderation team is watching_. You will be blocked if you get reported for any form of misconduct.
19.	Star the project.
20.	Add your name to the contributors listing in the README.md file in this repo and the members [repo](https://github.com/nodejsafrica/nodejsafrica/members ).
