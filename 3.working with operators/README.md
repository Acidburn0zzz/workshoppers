- Logical operators.
- Arithmetic operators.
- Assignment operators.

### Logical operators as the name sounds it helps us perform logical tasks, like comparing values to either a *true state* or *false state*.

like:
> same as or equal to operator **==**
> not operator **!**
> not equal to operator **!==**
> greater than **>**
> less than **<**
> greater than or equal to **>=**
> less than or equal to **<=**
> strict equal to **===**
> strict not equal to **!===**

### Arithmetic operators: operators that performs arithmetic operations 

like:
> Addition **+**
> Subtraction **-**
> Multiplication **'*'**
> Modules **%**
> Division **/**

### Assignment operators: operators that performs assigning operations

like:
> equal to **=**
> add and assign **+=**
> assign and add **=+**
> subtract and assign **-=**
> assign and subtract **=-**

Pretty much the name of the operators and they uses are quite the same. So, the fear of forgetting is out of equation.
